    <h2 class="centeredTitle">Hi, I'm Mohamed</h2>
    <p>I am an ambitious junior year student at Qatar University who enjoys learning about the wide realm of computer
        science and its applications. My goal is to develop and engineer technological solutions that can positively
        impact today's society, with an emphasis on those who are struggling with chronic illnesses and
        disabilities.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to tending to my academic duties, I also enjoy taking part in various extra-curricular activities,
        where I learn lots of valuable skills such as leadership, problem-solving and event organization.</p>
